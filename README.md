# SchuleDigital
This is a small project I used to prepare for my practical exam.  
I wanted to have a management system for a school to accomplish simple CRUD tasks,
such as create and manage students and teachers in the system, create and remove different subjects, but also assign grades to individual students.

The program was created with WinForms and uses the local SQL server provided by .NET.  
The main view is divided into a side navigation bar and a window area where the individual submenus are accessed.  
In order for the whole thing to run correctly, the appropriate database must be created, see the SQL file that goes with it.
